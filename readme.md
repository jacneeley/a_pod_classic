# APodClassic
APodClassic is a lean mp3 player app for older and smaller android devices.
I wanted a minimal and offline mp3 player that would allow me to listen to my music.
No algorithms, no data, no fluff. 

## Design goals
- offline
- secure 
- lean 
- robust 

## Development
This app is still in the beginning stages and mostly just for fun. 
I am learning android studio as I develop this. 
My plan is to hopefully have a public apk ready for side loading by the end of the year.
